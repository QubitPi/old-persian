    Old Persian is the name applied to the Persian language used in the cuneiform inscriptions of the Achaemenian dynasty; it can be localized as the langauge of southwestern Persia, or Persis in the narrower sense, and was the vernacular speech of the Achaemenian rulers.

    The Old Persian inscriptions are commonly accompanied also by translations into Elamite and Akkadian. Linguistically, Old Persian belongs to the Iranian branch of Indo-Iranian or Aryan, which is one of the main divisions of the Indo-European family of languages.
